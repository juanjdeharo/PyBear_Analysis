# PyBear_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
> V. Isualize has asked me to further analyze PyBer data and complete the following tasks in order to analyze average weekly fares by city type over time and possibly use this information for decision-making:

1. Create a summary DataFrame for the ride-sharing data by city type.
2. Create a multiple line graph displaying the average weekly fares by city type over time.
3. Write a report summarizing the findings

## Resources
